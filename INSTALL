* Anatomy of the tarball
The Declt distribution has the following shape:

./src/		;; source directory
./doc/		;; documentation


* Portability
Declt is an SBCL-only application (at least for now).


* Configuration
Edit Makefile.cnf to your specific needs.


* Pre-installation
If you're using ASDF 1, you need to "make install-system" before anything else
in order to create the system file symlink where appropriate. Otherwise (ASDF
2), we assume that you have unpacked somewhere in the source registry.


* Build
Type "make" to compile the reference manual. A side-effect of this is to also
compile the library. By default, the reference manual is built in info, PDF
and HTML formats. If you want other formats (DVI and PostScript are
available), type "make all-formats". You can also individually type "make dvi"
and/or "make ps" in order to get the corresponding format only.


* Installation
Type "make install" to install the reference manual. All generated versions
that are found are installed.


* Uninstallation
Type "make uninstall".


* Usage
Declt has a single entry point which is the DECLT function. See the docstring
for an explanation.
