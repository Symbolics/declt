* Anatomy of the tarball

The Declt distribution has the following shape:

./src/		;; source directory
./doc/		;; documentation


* Installing the code

** Edit Makefile.cnf
to tweak some installation parameters.

** For ASDF 1
*** make install
This will create the system file symlink.

** For ASDF 2
There is nothing to do if you're located somewhere in the source registry.


* Building and installing the reference manual
Declt can generate its own reference manual.

For ASDF 1, you need to have type "make install" first (that is why the
reference manual is not built by default). For ASDF 2, there is no
prerequisite as long as you're located somewhere in the source registry.

*** cd doc
*** Edit doc/generate.sh
most notably if asdf's *central-registry* or source registry needs tweaking. 
*** make ref
*** make install-ref

By default, documentation is built in info, PDF and HTML formats. If you want
other formats (DVI and PostScript are available), type "make all-formats". You
can also type individually "make dvi" and/or "make ps" in order to get the
corresponding format.

Finally, "make ref" also generates a "web" version of the reference manual
Texinfo source called decltweb.texi (see *link-files* for an explanation). If
you want to compare this version and the standard one, you can typeset the web
versions using "make pdfweb" and "make htmlweb".


* Uninstalling

Type "make uninstall".


* Usage

Declt has a single entry point which is the DECLT function. See the docstring
for an explanation.
