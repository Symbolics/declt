* Anatomy of the tarball

The Declt distribution has the following shape:

./src/		;; source directory
./doc/		;; documentation


* Building

** Edit Makefile.cnf if needed
All make targets from the toplevel propagate to the subdirectories.

** Type "make" from the toplevel directory
The build phase generates the documentation. By default, documentation is
built in info, PDF and HTML formats. If you want other formats (DVI and
PostScript are available), type "make all-formats" in the doc directory. You
can also type individually "make dvi" and/or "make ps" in order to get the
corresponding format.


* Installing

** Type "make install" from the toplevel directory
This installs the ASDF system file, the data and the documentation.


* Uninstalling

Type "make uninstall".
