* Anatomy of the tarball
The Declt distribution has the following shape:

./src/		;; source directory
./doc/		;; documentation
./emacs/        ;; Emacs edition utilities


* Portability


* Configuration
Edit Makefile.cnf to your specific needs.


* Pre-installation
If you're using ASDF 1, you need to "make install-system" before anything else
in order to create the system file symlink where appropriate. Otherwise (ASDF
2), we assume that you have unpacked somewhere in the source registry.


* Build
There's nothing to build by default. Declt can create its own reference manual
however. In order to do that, type "make ref". By default, the reference
manual is generated in info, PDF and HTML formats. If you want other formats
(DVI and PostScript are available), type "make all-formats-ref". You can also
individually type "make dvi-ref" and/or "make ps-ref" in order to get the
corresponding format only.


* Installation
Typing "make install" will install all generated versions of the reference
manual that you may have created.


* Uninstallation
Type "make uninstall".


* Usage
Declt has a single entry point which is the DECLT function. See the docstring
for an explanation.
