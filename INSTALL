2 Installation
**************

*Note Supported Platforms::, for information on portability and
requirements.  See Declt’s homepage for tarballs, Git repository and
online documentation.  Declt is also available via Quicklisp.  The
system’s name is com.dvlsoft.declt.

   In addition to the bare Lisp library, the Declt distribution offers
documentation in the form of 2 different manuals: user and reference.
The reference manual is generated with Declt itself.  Here are some
instructions for a manual installation, including documentation.

  1. Unpack somewhere in the ASDF source registry.
  2. Edit ‘Makefile.cnf’ to your specific needs.
  3. Type ‘make’ to compile the documentation (this also implies
     compiling and loading the library).  By default, the documentation
     is built in info, PDF and HTML formats.  If you want other formats
     (DVI and PostScript are available), type ‘make all-formats’.  You
     can also type individually ‘make dvi’ and/or ‘make ps’ in order to
     get the corresponding format.
  4. Type ‘make install’ to install the documentation.  If you have
     compiled the documentation in DVI and PostScript format, those will
     be installed as well.

   Type ‘make uninstall’ to uninstall the library.


A.1 Configuration
=================

Some aspects of Declt’s behavior can be configured _before_ the ASDF
system is actually loaded.  Declt looks for configuration options in a
variable called ‘com.dvlsoft.declt.configuration’ in the ‘cl-user’
package.  If set, this variable should contain a property list of
configuration options and their corresponding values.  Currently, the
following options are provided.

:swank-eval-in-emacs
     This option is only useful if you use Slime, and mostly if you plan
     on hacking Declt itself.  The library provides indentation
     information for some of its functions directly embedded in the
     code.  This information can be automatically transmitted to
     (X)Emacs when the ASDF system is loaded if you set this option to
     ‘t’.  However, note that for this to work, the Slime variable
     ‘slime-enable-evaluate-in-emacs’ must also be set to ‘t’ in your
     (X)Emacs session.  If you’re interested to know how this process
     works, I have described it in the following blog entry:
     <http://www.didierverna.com/sciblog/index.php?post/2011/07/20/One-more-indentation-hack>.


A.2 Supported Platforms
=======================

Declt currently works on Unix (including MacOS X) and Windows (Cygwin or
MinGW) with SBCL. Other Lisp implementations are not currently
supported, as Declt relies on SBCL’s sb-introspect contrib.

   Declt also requires ASDF 3.
