* Anatomy of the source tree

The Declt source tree has the following shape:

./src/		;; source directory
./doc/		;; documentation


* Configuration
You may need to edit Makefile.cnf and doc/generate.sh in order to tweak some
installation parameters.


* Building and installing
There is nothing to build or install, so no need to type "make" or "make
install". If you're using ASDF 1 however, you will want to "make
install-system" in order to create the system file symlink where appropriate.


* Building and installing the reference manual
Declt can generate its own reference manual.

If you're using ASDF 1, you need to have typed "make install-system" first
(that is why the reference manual is not built by default).

To generate the reference manual, type "make ref".
To install it, type "make install-ref".

By default, the reference manual is built in info, PDF and HTML formats. If
you want other formats (DVI and PostScript are available), type "make
all-formats". You can also type individually "make dvi" and/or "make ps" in
order to get the corresponding format.

You may also generate a "web", unlinked version of the reference manual (see
the variable *link-files* for an explanation) by typing "make refweb" or "make
pdfweb" and "make htmlweb" individually.


* Uninstalling

Type "make uninstall".


* Usage

Declt has a single entry point which is the DECLT function. See the docstring
for an explanation.
