Declt (pronounce dec'let) is a reference manual generator for Common Lisp.
It extracts and formats documentation from ASDF systems, including the system
itself, its local dependencies (subsystems), components, packages and an
extensive list of definitions (variables, functions etc.). The formatted
documentation comes with full indexing and cross-references.

Reference manuals are generated in Texinfo format which can subsequently be
converted into info, HTML, DVI, PostScript or PDF.
