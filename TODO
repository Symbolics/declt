* Index dependencies
ASDF maintains dependencies as a list of names only, so this makes it harder
to find the corresponding component.

* Texify all strings
this must include symbol names for instance.

* Cleanup the indexes
Files should be indexed with extension and relative path to avoid collisions.

* See about shadowed symbols

* Generalize escape
so as to avoid (format nil "~A" balh) to use it.
Also look into ~/name/ in format.
