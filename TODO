** Packages and symbols
See what to do about shadowings, imports etc.

** String downcasing
Abstract it so that we may provide an option for case behavior.

** Backend
Clean up the code so that Texinfo becomes a backend with a clean
interface. This way, we could envision adding other backends. Part of the
cleanup would also be to decide on a good coding style for fresh lines
(FRESH-LINE, TERPRI, ~& and ~%).

** Pathnames
If the system definition pathname or definition sources contain funky stuff
like ./, ../ or even are symlinks, the cross-references will most probably
break. We need to work on canonical pathnames.

** Foreign definitions
Because of the way we collect our definitions (system -> packages -> symbols),
we're currently unable to document foreign definitions, that is, provided in a
file of ours but belonging to a foreign package.

In general, it's not clear whether we want to do that. In some specific cases
however, it does makes sense; when the foreign definition has something to do
with the current system for instance. In those cases, we are in fact usually
able to get a handle to the definition in question.  For instance, method
definitions for foreign generic functions (e.g. MOP extensions such as
VALIDATE-SUPERCLASS) may be retreived from classes direct methods.

Even then, the next problem is where to advertise those definitions. They are
neither internal, nor exported. Maybe we could add a section for foreign
definitions.

Other definitions potentially concerned:
-  setf expanders for which the access-fn is foreign, but the
update-fn is ours. I currently don't know how to retrieve those.

** Floating setf expanders
Setf expanders are documented when the access-fn is a (generic) function or
macro. If a setf expander is defined on a symbol that has no such definition
(which is possible), it will not currently appear anywhere. What should we do?
Probably create toplevel setf expander definitions.
