** Index dependencies
ASDF maintains dependencies as a list of names only, so this makes it harder
to find the corresponding component.

** See sb-introspect for a list of other things that we could possibly document
That would be symbol-macros, compiler-macros, types, setf expanders and method
combinations.

** Cleanup up the string-downcase issue
so that it would be easier afterwards to provide an option for case behavior.

** Canonicalize pathnames
If the system definition pathname or definition sources contain funky stuff
like ./, ../ or even are symlinks, the cross-references will most probably
break. We need to work on canonical pathnames.

** Document class slots
and point back to slot accessors.
