* Index dependencies
ASDF maintains dependencies as a list of names only, so this makes it harder
to find the corresponding component.

* See about shadowed symbols

* See sb-introspect for a list of other things that we could possibly document

* Sort out the case of (setf blah).

* Cleanup up the string-downcase issue
so that it would be easier afterwards to provide an option for case behavior.

* Canonicalize pathnames
If the system definition pathname or definition sources contain funky stuff
like ./, ../ or even are symlinks, the cross-references will most probably
break. We need to work on canonical pathnames.
