* Index dependencies
ASDF maintains dependencies as a list of names only, so this makes it harder
to find the corresponding component.

* Texify all strings
this must include symbol names for instance.

* Cleanup rendering
Every function that renders something should be called do-stuff, with a
corresponding stuff function that just returns the string, no rendered onto
any stream.
