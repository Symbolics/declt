### Code:

# Installation prefix. This is used for installing Declt as follows:
# - $(PREFIX)/share/common-lisp/systems/ for the system file (ASDF 1)
# - $(PREFIX)/share/doc/declt/ for the PDF documentation
# - $(PREFIX)/share/info/ for the info documentation
# If any of these are unsatisfactory, you will need to edit the Makefiles, or
# do the installation by hand.
PREFIX := /usr/local

# Lisp implementation to use (for some installation processing steps only):
# Currently, only SBCL is supported
LISP := SBCL

# Implementation paths:
SBCL_PATH  := sbcl
#CMUCL_PATH := lisp
#CCL_PATH   := ccl
#ECL_PATH   := ecl
# -q is needed to remove 'bye' for version.cl to work properly.
#CLISP_PATH := CC=$(CC) clisp -q

# For ABCL, we need something slightly different.
#ABCL_JAR   := /usr/local/src/common-lisp/abcl/dist/abcl.jar
#JAVA       := java
#JAVAC      := javac
#JAR        := jar
#SED        := sed
#ABCL_PATH  := abcl
