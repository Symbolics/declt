# Installation prefix.
# - ASDF file will be symlinked in $(PREFIX)/share/common-lisp/systems
# - Documentation will end up in $(PREFIX)/share/doc/declt/
#                            and $(PREFIX)/share/info/
# If any of these are unsatisfactory, you will need to edit the Makefiles, or
# do the installation by hand.
PREFIX := /usr/local

# Programs for generating the documentation:
MAKEINFO = makeinfo
